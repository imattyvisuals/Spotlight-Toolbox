# ESL Toolbox

# Project Description

ESL Toolbox is a resource hub for students and teachers of ESL.

ESL students who wish to supplement their learning with online resources often wonder where to go to further their studies, whether it be to learn or review certain concepts, or to practice by doing online exercises. There are a number of good resources available for students, as well as for teachers, to use. This is where ESL Toolbox comes in. Rather than having to make a note of a number of different websites, links to various online resources have been collected and organized here in one place so that students and teachers only need to remember and use one website: ESL Toolbox.

This responsive front-end website was created using JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML. The font used ('Quicksand') comes from Google Fonts. The landing page image comes from Pexels. The icons used on the Search, Back, and Back-To-Top buttons come from Font Awesome. The Share buttons on the landing page come from ShareThis. The Comments section is powered by GraphComment. The ESL Toolbox logo, the images used on the cards, and the preview image (see screenshot #4 below) was created using Canva.

Open Graph Tags have been added so that when a link to or from the website is shared and posted (e.g. on Facebook), the desired image and text will be shown (see screenshot #4 below). A sitemap has been added and submitted to Google, and Google Search Console is used for this website to check the indexing status and to optimize the visibility of the website.
