The icons used on the Search, Back, and Back-To-Top buttons come from Font Awesome. The Share buttons on the landing page come from ShareThis. The Comments section is powered by GraphComment. The Spotlight Toolbox logo, the images used on the cards was designed using Adobe Illustrator.

Open Graph Tags have been added so that when a link to or from the website is shared and posted (e.g. on Facebook), the desired image and text will be shown (see screenshot #4 below). A sitemap has been added and submitted to Google, and Google Search Console is used for this website to check the indexing status and to optimize the visibility of the website.
